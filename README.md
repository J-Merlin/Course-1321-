# Course-1321-
This is a repository for my Java Programs from my intro-to-programming class @ KSU


=====THIS REPOSITORY IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.=====

1. I have chosen to make this public to familiarize myself with navigating Github in a professional sense. 

2. All code on this repository is written by me but with help from educational resources mainly textbook samples.
